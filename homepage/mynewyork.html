    <h5> My New York</h5>
            <p>Why does everything have to be changing all the time? I suppose it’s human nature to expect change. Perhaps the internet made us unsatisfied with what we have, hungry for something new. The canal in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, the home to first and second generation Russian Americans, grounds me and other Russian immigrants in the complexity of a consumer driven city.  I’m not sure I can return the favor. As products of our environment, the second generation of Sheepshead Bay children are more American than Russian.
             So many children of Russian immigrants learn how to walk on the canal with the aid of their grandparents holding their hand. While children have their first Mr. Softee from the iconic NYC soft serve ice cream trucks for the first time, an experience shared by all the children of NYC, bought by their grandparents who could no longer endure the whining of their grandchildren. The restaurants that teenagers go to by the canal where they hold their first awkward dates. The children grew up, and their grandparents grew old, yet the canal held on to those memories. The canal held on to the hole of generational neglect many parents inflicted on their children as they were forced to sacrifice time with their children in pursuit of the American dream. Parental figures were temporarily filled by grandparents.
             </p>
               <p>When real people want to escape oppression, start a new life, find opportunities, seek contentment, immigration serves as a golden ticket to happiness. They immigrate to places that have their own cultural bubbles that ground them, cultural commonality making them feel accepted in foreign terrain. Do they speak my first tongue, do they eat my mother’s cooking, do they knock on wood after saying something ridiculous? When the Soviet Union collapsed during the 1990’s, Russians, especially minority groups such as Russian Jews and politicians that supported communism, had to flee the country and sought asylum in Sheepshead Bay. It was relatively cheaper to live there than in Manhattan or downtown Brooklyn and there was a beautiful landmark, the canal, and a metro station nearby. Most importantly, there was already a Russian community there. The great Russian migration from the Soviet Union began. These people wished to live out the capitalist paradise they were secretly advertised by American propaganda centered around that beautiful canal. In a sense, that canal is St. Petersburg. The community of these civil-war torn Russians who built NYC bleeds Russian culture.
                    However, these Russian immigrants will never be “true” Americans. They arrived in this country and embraced the American dream and the idea of a capitalist paradise enticed every prospective business owner and their busy bees to create it on the canal. Today, the canal is lined with luxurious three-story private houses on one side facing Manhattan Beach and Russian-owned restaurants on the other. Some of my first memories of the canal were based on these restaurants: Ogni Baku, Roll n Roaster, and Rocca Cafe. Although the most significant memory I’ve had here was one day when I was feeding the swans swimming in the murky, polluted canal water, it was with my grandpa, and the emotional connections and conversations I’ve had with him on this canal are unforgettable. Me and my grandpa walked up to the canal to feed the ducks and swans stale bread my mom ordered us to “get rid of.” (Bread is an important aspect of Russian culture and is seen as sacred ever since the horrors of World War 2 and the induced starvation the Germans caused during the blockade of Leningrad to the children of the War. My grandma was born two months after the fall of the blockade. Abandoned, put up for adoption.) </p>
        <p>
            As we fed the ducks and walked along the canal, he told me of his childhood. How his mother would bring him food to the children’s camps the Russians made to protect the children of the war. How he was telling his mother, not fully capable of understanding what was going on, drowned in fear and confusion that a child won’t understand, how they were dropping bombs. He also told me about the electrification of the Soviet Union sponsored by Lenin’s policy. How his village “under-Moscow” had no electricity until one night the people came and drew the power lines. After a few weeks there was light. A concept so bizarre to him, yet something I take for granted every second since maybe a week after I learned how to flip a light switch at the age of two. I love him. The stories he tells, and hopefully will tell for the years to come. His witty humour, and his secrecy about the tea he has with family members and who he worked for for the Soviet Union. He’s mysterious yet so genuine. Filled with love and kindness.
                    The children of the canal, the heirs of these post-USSR immigrants, are mostly spoiled, selfish, and egotistical/narcissistic people. They grew up surrounded by this rampant American consumerism and their parents bought into it. They were never rejected due to the price tag and gave into trends and peer pressure. iPods since elementary schools, iPhones in 4th grade, hoverboards in 2015, and American snacks whenever. The spoils for these children, however, were something I always desired to have. A few of them, anyways, are either humble or selfless. This consumerism and social class fare didn’t get to their head. Nonetheless, these children talk in English without a Russian accent and grew up with opportunities only capitalism and NYC allowed them to have. Walking down the canal, with their white Nike’s, newest iPhones, with that for some reason they take pride in having; these children are more American than their parents. I am afraid of them. As they walk down the canal I am afraid that as they grow up and displace the older generation of Russian migrants into Kings Highway and Ocean Parkway that these kids will change the canal. Make it more “trendy” less “old-style” or Russian, and create more of the emptiness already present in Times Square.
